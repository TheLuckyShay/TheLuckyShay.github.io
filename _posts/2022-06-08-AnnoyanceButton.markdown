## FAQ (and their mostly roundabout answers)
- ### What was your inspiration for this idea? In fact, what posessed you to bring such a device to life?
  I recieved an AWS IOT button as a gift a couple years ago. Every single time I looked at it, I wondered: "What in the world could I make with something with only 3 inputs which is actually useful?". Over time, as I looked at more and more options, I realized that the project I make using this doesn't have to be useful! In fact, it doesn't have to be remotely even close! 

  With that realization, I decided to use it to aid my eternal quest to annoy my sister (as you do). After going through several options on how to go about that, I settled on this!
- ### Why did you choose the tech stack (AWS and Selenium) for this project?
  I started with a small test: a script which will use the Instagram API in order to send a message to myself. Unfortunately, the longer I looked through the API documentation, the more I realized it would be easier and more efficient to use Selenium in order to accomplish my task. As a bonus, I'd be able to use it with every other service I planned on using!

  As for AWS, I used it because I already had an IOT button and that's what this project was inspired by.
